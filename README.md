# Tic_Tac_Toe_Project


Hi there, This is my Tic-Tac-Toe Project.

• Used Mini-Max Backtracking Algorithm.

• Mini-Max Algo is used in decision-making and game theory.

• It provides an optimal move for the player assuming that opponent is also playing optimally.

• Revised and Explored some Algorithms, and practiced a lot of Stuff.
